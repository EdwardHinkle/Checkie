# Checkie
*The quickest iOS foursquare Client in the old west*

Checkie is a [foursquare](http://www.foursquare.com) client for the iOS from [tijo, inc](http://tijo.me). Built completely on the night of January 28th, 2012 from some sketches on a napkin, the code isn't quite super-high quality.

The App aims to essentially combine foursquare with Amazon 1-Click, you tap on a venue and **BAM**, you're checked in. I kept finding that after visiting a place I always ended up stalling friends with conversation while checking in because foursquare takes several taps to check in. It even spawns a background task so you can close it the second you attempt to check in.

**NOTE**: There are several #warnings in the App for foursquare OAuth and Flurry keys that I stripped from the App. In order for it to function as normal you'll need to provide these keys.
